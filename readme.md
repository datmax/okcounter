# Ok counter

So, we have a teacher that says "ok" something like 100 times in an hour(for real).

I decided it would have been a fun idea to make a program that counts how many okays she says automatically.

## Set up

Run   ```npm run serve ``` from inside the ```client``` folder to start the frontend.

Run ```nodemon index``` to start the backend(on port 3000).

## Q:Wait, why do you need a backend?

I wanted to make an app that displayed in real time the number of okays she said during the lectures.

__The only problem is that i can't make the SpeechRecognition api work properly__.

It stops sometimes, sometimes it doesn't.

Anyway, this project will be discontinued until at least mid-November due to exams.

Any help is appreciated!
